(a) AZAL relies on Silk Way Technics, which has control over and subscribes to AMASIS, the system used for managing AZAL's aircraft records. In the unfortunate event that Silk Way Technics terminates their contract or ceases operations, it would create a significant risk for AZAL, as it could potentially lead to the loss of the electronic aircraft records, which are currently maintained by Silk Way Technics through AMASIS.
(b) During the audit, it was discovered that two Certificate of Release to Service (CRS) documents with the same reference number (SWT BM 00256), revision number, time, and date of issue, stamped by the same individual certifying the same work, existed in the CAMO records system. However, these documents contained different flight hour information. Upon addressing the issue with the Contracted Maintenance organization, it was revealed that the CRS had been reissued to correct the aircraft's hours/cycles immediately after the initial issuance, on the same day and at the same hour.

(b) Several training records of the Airworthiness Review (AR) staff members were found to be inconsistent with the competence requirements stated in CAME paragraph 2.8.7. Specifically, certain training courses such as AAR 145, Compliance monitoring, and Maintenance Programmes had not been completed by some staff members.
(c) Additionally, it was observed that the Master Training record form lacks specific dates indicating when the courses were completed. Furthermore, a list of four EWIS courses or four CDCCL courses was provided without any accompanying dates. This absence of dates hinders the traceability and verification of the currency of training for AR staff members.

(e) Furthermore, it was revealed that certain AR staff members had been authorized to conduct Airworthiness Reviews on Airbus aircraft, despite not having undergone training specific to typical Airbus aircraft. It is worth noting that Airbus aircraft have distinct system architectures that differ from Boeing types.
